# **Project Hatchet Studio**

## **About Us**

- A few Arma mod developers got together in 2021 and started the open-source Project Hatchet Studio because we noticed a lack of quality interactive vehicle interiors and a lack of understanding of HUD elements. Arma 3 community. The actual Hatchet Project has been in development since 2018, with the original project the [h-60]( https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/223859-h-60-interactive-blackhawk-pack-public-beta-03-released-development-restarted-join-our-discord/)

- It all started with [ITC AIR]( https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1321663083) and [ITC land]( https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1388192893) with Yax creating Armaâ€™s First IR aircraft pointer, which allowed aircraft to mark targets at night for the infantry. Another Arma first was making the Rover feed allowing ground units to see the Pod feed on fix winged air support assets. After working ITC, AIR/Land  Yax worked on the [F/A-18]( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=743099837) where he made an interactive cockpit and integrated ITC AIR., and wing flex during turning, not to mention numerous real-world and simulated weapon systems.   

- Our vision is to make the most functional aircraft and ground vehicle that has ever been made in Arma, incorporating all of the lessons learned over the years. Our scope is modeling realistic vehicle interior interiors and cockpits that are fully interactive with clickable cockpits. We will focus on quality over mass production. We plan to achieve this by making all of our projects open-source and recruiting developers that share our vision (and are as sick as I am of blowing up randomly in modded helicopters while landing as I am ). We will focus on training and guiding new members through the difficulties of navigating modding in Arma. The end state of our project is educating and spreading knowledge across the multiple projects running simultaneously.
